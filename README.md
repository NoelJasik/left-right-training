# Left-Right Training website

Welcome to the Left-Right Training website, built using React. This website is designed to help improve your ability to distinguish between left and right directions. I created this project, because during my driving lessons, i kept confusing which direction is left and which is right, so when instructed to turn left, i turned right, this happend to me more than i would like to admit.
